Hello, I am Ishan Sathe. I am going to be the Strongest Person in the World.
I am currently working on an Anti-Phishing project. This will be proprietary and hence won't be revealed on my GitHub.

To hone and develop my skills. I also build projects that can help solve my problems. If they can solve my problems, they can solve anyone else's.

My most recent project on GitHub is the Expense Tracking application. My dad often asks me to keep a track of my expenses. I didn't want to write them on Notepad.
I also did not want to maintain an Excel sheet. I thought of creating an application instead.

As I grow stronger, I choose bigger and better issues. I also focus more towards business cases and real world value. I believe in providing value to the world.
My strength will be such that anyone will be benefitted more by being my friend rather than being my enemy.
That is, the amount of help I can give would be more than the damage I could do.

You can reach out to me on:

Email: ishansatheprofessional@gmail.com

LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishan-sathe-deeptech/

My experiences lie in:
- Sales
- Business Development
- Management
- Coding
- Optimization

I understand that this is a coding platform and I should focus more on presenting my technical skills too. But I am balanced in that perspective.
